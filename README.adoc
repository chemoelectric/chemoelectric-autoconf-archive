= Chemoelectric’s Autoconf Archive

This is a collection of freely reusable macros for GNU Autoconf.

Some of the macros will depend on the GNU Autoconf Archive. See
https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/

To learn about GNU Autoconf itself, see

There are often misunderstandings about GNU Autoconf, such as that it
has a direct relationship with makefiles. GNU Autoconf is not a
special tool for configuring makefiles. I quote from
https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ (2025-11-20):
[.excerpt]
----
Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
----
The shell scripts can configure anything the programmer wishes. I have
used them to configure, for instance, Nix flakes.

This archive _does_, however, include macros _for use along with GNU
Automake_ (https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/), to configure
makefiles for GNU Make (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
